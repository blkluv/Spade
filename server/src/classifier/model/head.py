"""
Simple head for the playing card classifier. Takes the extracted features as input
and outputs a probability distribution over:
14 Ranks (Ace-King), 14 is the Joker
4 Suits (Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts)
Idea to improve: https://github.com/luuuyi/CBAM.PyTorch/blob/master/model/resnet_cbam.py
